## Quick Start
### Preparation
- Import the IP-ASN32-DAT file into the ```Luori/pyasn_data``` folder.
- Import the seeded data into the ```Luori/routingprefix_dataset``` folder classified by routing prefix.
  
  To avoid folder symbol ```/``` ,please use ```_```.
  For exmaple, use the name of ```2a00:1c50:94::_48.txt```  instead of ```2a00:1c50:94::/48.txt``` as the name of txt file.

### Step1 : Make Pickle File
```bash
python3 pickle_maker.py
```

### Step2 : Set the config
set the config in ```MCTS_Search/config.py```

Type your passport in ```passport```

Type your local ipv6 address in ```local_ipv6```

### Step3 : Run Luori
- For Seeded Routing Prefix
```bash
python3 MCTS_Search/MCTS_seeded_controller.py
```

- For Unseeded Routing Prefix
```bash
python3 MCTS_Search/MCTS_unseeded_controller.py
```
